## I'm a student at [ [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/) ] <br/> <sub> a 42 programming school founded by Supercell <sub/>

Before Hive I studied game programming at mediastadi. I also used to study art & 3D modeling.<br/>
***C*** *and* ***C++*** *are currently my most used languages*.<br/>

### Projects at Hive Helsinki
>[!NOTE]
>Hive has specific, strict rules that you must follow.<br/><br/>
Most notably, **nearly all projects are made almost entirely from scratch - not even the standard library can be used & only specific system calls are allowed.** These restrictions are lighter for C++ projects, but are in full force for C.

Formatting of the code is also very limited, most important being: 25 rows per function, 5 functions per file, 80 char row width.
