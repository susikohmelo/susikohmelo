# Hi! ‚òù
### I am a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/) ( a 42 programming school )
---
Before Hive I **studied game programming at mediastadi**. I also **used to study art & 3D modeling**, which has come incredibly handy.

**C & C++** are currently my most used languages, with low-level technical programming peaking my interest.

### Projects at Hive Helsinki
>Hive has very specific and strict rules that you must follow. Breaking any of them means you get 0%.

Most notably, **nearly all projects are made almost entirely from scratch,** ***not even the standard library is allowed.***<br/>
Any and all functions you want to use, even the simplest ones like strlen() you must make yourself. Only specific system calls are allowed for each project, all others being forbidden.

Formatting of the code is also very limited, most important being: 25 rows per function, 5 functions per file, 80 char max row width.

| Project Name  | Description | Libraries used | Languages |
