## I'm currently a student at the [ [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/) ] 42 programming school

>Before Hive I studied game programming at mediastadi. I also used to study art & 3D modeling.<br/>
>***C*** *and* ***C++*** *are currently my most used languages*, with low-level technical programming in general peaking my interest.<br/>

### Projects at Hive Helsinki
>[!NOTE]
>Hive has specific, strict rules that you must follow.<br/><br/>
Most notably, ***nearly all projects are made almost entirely from scratch*** - *only specific system calls are allowed and not even the standard library can be used.* These restrictions are lighter for C++ projects, but are in full force for C.

Any and all functions you want to use, even the simplest ones such as strlen() you must make yourself. Only specific system calls are allowed for each project, all others being forbidden.

Formatting of the code is also very limited, most important being: 25 rows per function, 5 functions per file, 80 char max row width.
