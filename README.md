# Hi! ‚òù
### I am a student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/) ( a 42 programming school ).
---
Before Hive I **studied game programming at mediastadi**.<br/>
I also **used to study art & 3D modeling** which has come incredibly handy.

**C & C++** are currently my most used languages, and low-level technical programming peaks my interest.
